### Part 1: **Introduction**

Welcome to your TOM Makeathon! You are standing in the epicenter of innovation - where people with disabilities and Makers are brought together to develop affordable solutions for everyday challenges.

Whether your Makeathon has 80 participants or 800 participants, the model is the same. Your participants are split into teams and each are assigned to a challenge presented by a Need Knower. Each team has one goal for 72 hours: develop a solution to address the challenge.

**Length: **72 hours

**Locations: **An accessible space that can safely house a three day makeathon that involves modern manufacturing tools. We recommend steering clear of carpeted spaces.

**Choosing a date:** Set aside a minimum of 3-4 months for planning from the date you sign the 1st licensing agreement.

**Funds: **TOM Makeathons are grassroots undertakings by your community. It is your event and you will be responsible to secure partnerships to fund the event. The TOM team will provide advice and templates to help you secure funding. Fundraising efforts at the event can be used to support the Makeathon or to support continued development of open source products designed at the makeathon.

**Registration Fees:** Registration fees ensure that people take attendance seriously, minimize no-shows, and cover some of the cost. Communities have charged from $40 to $150. Confirm the amount with your TOM POC. When registration is carefully handled, TOM events have less than 2 percent no-shows!

**Attendance:** Depending on your license level, your Makeathon involves up to 80, 150 or an unlimited number of attendees. When setting up your teams, you will generally assign 3-7 participants to each.

**Naming: **TOM's are always organized as open innovation events for a local community. You have three choices for your name, whichever you choose will need to be approved by your TOM POC. Naming options are:

1. TOM:Full city or neighborhood name  (i.e. TOM:New York City or TOM:Wall Street) **or **TOM:Acronym (i.e. TOM:NYC)

2. **Universities: **Students, we want to encourage you to build the TOM community on campus. You have one more naming choice TOM:University Name or TOM:University Acronym

3. **Co-events: **Events organized as part of a global community, events or conferences.

4. If the Makeathon is not stand alone, the event or conference name can be added to the TOM Makeathon name but will need to be approved by your point of contact.
