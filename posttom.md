### **Part 12: PostTOM **

TOM does not end on Demo Day. Follow-up and PostTOM activities are crucial for the prototypes to get to customers and for the TOM community to strive.

PostTOM activities have two very concrete goals:

1. **Upload prototypes on the temporary [Open Makers Market](http://www.tomglobal.org/projects)
**Each team is responsible for uploading the product file to the Open Makers Market.

2. **Connect participants and form [TOM:Developer Groups](http://tomglobal.org/makers/) **
These are teams that work on TOM projects on an ongoing basis

The key for success for both is the **PostTOM Meeting**

**PostTOM Meeting** {#meeting}

You had a blast for 3 days - let's meet up for a mini-reunion! This event should happen about a month after TOM, giving everyone some time to regain lost sleep and the videographer time to finish up the video from the event.

Choose a nice space where you can set up chairs as an auditorium and mingle. Pick up some light refreshments (beer is always appreciated).

Suggested PostTOM structure:

1. Meet and greet

2. Thank everyone for participating and for their time and dedication, pay tribute to sponsors and reiterate prize winners

3. Invite people to register **on the spot **for the TOM:Developer Group in your locality.  A TOM:Developer Group is a weekly afternoon activity, supported and connected to the TOM movement, for developing and delivering open source assistive technology. If there still not one in your area - go online and form one, before PostTOM!

4. Close with the Makeathon's highlight video

5. Invite leading figures in the community, whom you may have identified during TOM, to take part in planning and running the evening. The more people are involved in creating PostTOM, the stronger community circles are going to be.

TIPS: Pick up cool swag, print pictures from the TOM on magnets, decorate the room in TOM colors.
