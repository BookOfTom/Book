#### GLOSSARY

We have a lot to cover in the Book of TOM, familiarize yourself with our terminology before getting started!

**Applicants vs. Participants**

**Applicants: **Makers and Need Knowers that submit** applications** to participate in a TOM Makeathon. Since TOMs are normally overbooked, not all applicants will become participants.

**Participants: **Makers and Need Knowers that have been accepted to TOM and completed their** registration form**.

**Challenges vs. ****Projects**

**Challenges:** identified challenges presented by a Need Knower where the market forces fail or the existing solution is not affordable.

**Projects: **prototyped solution for the challenges, developed by teams at TOM. Teams start working at PreTOM, turning Challenges into Projects.

**Need Knowers**

Individuals with a personal understanding of the needs of people with disabilities. In most cases these are the ones living with disabilities themselves; in others, these are relatives, caregivers or professionals. At a TOM Makeathon, Need Knowers are critical  to teams—working alongside the Makers through each stage of prototyping.

**Makeathon**

TOM Makeathons are 72-hour long marathons of non-stop problem-solving by teams of Makers and Need Knowers. A makeathon is a **hackathon-style-event, **not unsimilar to regular hackathons run by developers.

**Makeathon Hub**

The TOM-hosted online platform to design and manage the makeathon from end to end.  Each event organizer will have access to their platform to recruit Need Knowers and Makers and collect the data in an organized way.

**Maker**

Designers, developers, engineers and anyone who loves creating. At TOM, Makers are the ones that execute every stage of the prototype, turning an idea into a reality. (See: [Maker ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture)[Culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maker_culture))



**Makerspace**

The actual space of a Makeathon: where teams get to work and tools are available for participants. Expect to find both modern rapid prototyping tools, such as laser cutters and 3D printers, and traditional tools such as sewing, welding and woodworking.

**PiNG: Progress, Needs & Goals **

A short stand up meeting with representatives from each team. PiNG generally happens every 8 hours during the Makeathon to identify the teams' Progress, Needs & Goals and to break the makeathon for the teams into digestible chunks of time. This is a group effort, so remember there is no 'i’ in PiNG!

**Pre-existing Makerspace**

A pre-existing machine shop with high and low tech manufacturing tools already in place. Check out [Community Makerspaces](http://www.hackerspaces.org/), [FabLabs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fab_lab), and [Techshops](http://www.techshop.ws/).

**TOM POC**

Throughout the Book, we will refer to your point of contact as TOM POC, this is the member of the TOM Staff that is dedicated to supporting you through the planning experience.
