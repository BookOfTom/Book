#### Working with People with Disabilities

As you start planning, you'll be reaching out to partners and Need Knowers, discussing challenges, disabilities, and people with disabilities. Take a few minutes and familiarize yourself with some pointers about working with people with disabilities. Every country and culture has their own sensitivities, if you’re unsure about how to phrase something, just ask, in general people would prefer you ask rather than make an assumption.

**1.	Ask before you assume: **use appropriate terminology when working with someone with a disability, you can ask what terminology they prefer beforehand.

**2. Get to know the person behind the disability:** you'll be spending every waking moment with this person for 72 hours, don’t just learn their disability, go out of your way to *schmooze* with them at lunch or over coffee during a break and find out what makes them tick!

**3.	Avoid offensive terms:** Appropriate terminology includes: "Need Knower," “people with disabilities” and “a person with a visual, hearing, physical, speech, or cognitive impairment.” Avoid: restricted to a wheelchair, victim of, suffers from, retarded, deformed, crippled, and physically challenged. Remember, you can always ask the person with a disability what they prefer.

*Note: Although ***_handicapped_*** is widely used in both law and everyday speech to refer to people having physical or mental disabilities, those described by the word tend to prefer the expressions disabled or people with disabilities. (Source:American Heritage Dictionary)*

**4.	Talk directly to the person with the disability**, and not to the attendant, caregiver, or interpreter. Although they may look at the interpreter while talking to you, keep your focus on the person you're talking with.

**5.**	**Speak in your normal voice, **sometimes people have a tendency to talk louder or slower to a person with a disability. However, you should never assume that the person you are talking to has a hearing or cognitive impairment.

**6.**	**Ask before helping. **It's easy to want to rush to help someone who is struggling, but before offering your assistance make sure you ask the person if they would like your help.

**7.	Use "people-first" language **when you refer to people with disabilities: “a man who is deaf” rather than “a deaf man,” and “a woman who uses a wheelchair” rather than “a wheel-chair bound woman.”

**8.	Be aware of personal space. **Wheelchairs, walkers, canes, and other mobility aids are considered personal space. Out of respect and safety, don't touch, move, or lean on them.

*"This is what I've been thinking of for years which is getting people like myself, the Need Knowers and sitting down with professionals, putting our ideas together, and making things that will actually help people." *- Kim Lathrop
