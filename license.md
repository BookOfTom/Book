### Part 2: **License **

Joining the TOM franchise to organize a local TOM Makeathon is free. However, you will sign the licensing agreement to confirm responsibility for established TOM values, methodology, guidelines and quality measures.

The abridged licensing model document can be [viewed here](http://static1.squarespace.com/static/56d2f7d71bbee09a4bcca663/t/57161ea2c6fc084899f642ad/1461067456472/License+Model+Outline.pdf).

**How to apply for a license: **Visit [http://tomglobal.org/host-a-tom](http://tomglobal.org/host-a-tom).  Tell us a bit about yourself, your community and your plans for running a local TOM. Answer the questions as best as you can. We want to get a feel for how much you have already thought about planning the Makeathon.

**Introduction Meeting: **This is an online rendezvous where you meet the point of contact (TOM POC). They will jump-start the conversation by telling you what it takes to run a Makeathon.

**Signing on: **When you are ready, we'll send you the License 1 agreement,** **you will have 1 week to sign on the dotted line. While an organization may wish to take responsibility for organizing the event, **the signer is the official event organizer.** If you are under 18 years old, you will be required to include an older co-signer.

**License 1 **defines the terms and time frame towards moving forward (Final Go). You receive the Book of TOM, meet with your TOM POC, build your budget and begin organizing logistics and securing partnerships for the Makeathon. Don't go public until you sign License 2.

**License 2** gives you permission to run a franchised TOMGlobal event. At the signing, you will set milestones to measure success of the event together with your TOM POC.

**Final Go****:** Complete all partnerships, finalize production details and run TOM. Depending on license level, TOM team sends one or more representatives to the event to help in facilitation and  coordination of the Makeathon.

**Emergency situations: **If you need to change organizers, you need to speak with your TOM POC and a new organizer will need to sign the license. The TOM POC has the right to decline a change of organizer and cancel the event.
