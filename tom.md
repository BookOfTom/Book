### Part 11: **TOM**

You're up to Part 11. Let’s take a moment and recap on the goals the TOM Makeathon:

1. To develop working prototypes of products that assist and empower people living with disabilities

2. To inspire, motivate and empower a movement of technology Makers working to address needs that either have no solution, or the existing solutions are too expensive to be affordable.



The 72 hours Makeathon is the cornerstone towards achieving both. This chapter is about the design and operation of a makeathon, introducing the facilitation, the right atmosphere and driving a power of innovation in the unique and exciting space.

TOM is a hackathon-style-event, in a methodology we named 'Intentional Makeathons'. This is how it all unfolds.

#### **A. Planning your TOM: Concept, Schedule and Facilitation** {#planning}

TOM events are 72 hours of making. We define them this way because in most cases, the Makeathon is not divided into days and nights - it's one long strip of action.  A TOM’s schedule is very simple and in its core is a long chunk of  undisturbed **Team Time - **time for the teams to work.

We call this long chunk **a lane**, and normally accompany it with two more lanes: a content lane called **Campus **and a check-ins' lane called **PiNG. **For a graphical representation of the same see an example for a printed TOM schedule here: [https](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bwn21wgFSSMfM1lnbzN0VzZYVHc)[://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bwn21wgFSSMfM1lnbzN0VzZYVHc](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0Bwn21wgFSSMfM1lnbzN0VzZYVHc)

There are three main blocks of time that every TOM event must follow: Team Time, Campus Lane and PiNGs. We've included a template for the schedule in the Makeathon Hub to help you build the schedule for the event.

1. Opening Ceremony

2. Safety Instructions

3. Team Time

4. Campus Lane

5. PiNG

6. Demo Day

##### 1. Opening Ceremony

It's time to be motivational, high energy, and excited! You are going to keep the opening ceremony short and sweet! All the teams were at the PreTOM and are ready to start. You should take 10 minutes to go over a few key points - then get to work.

1. Review the mission of TOM

2. Everyone needs to wear their nametag

3. Go over the schedule

4. Point out key people

5. Review the workshop rules

6. GET TO WORK!!

##### 2.  Safety Instructions

Immediately after the opening ceremony, you break off groups to explain the safety instructions while the other groups begin working.

Safety rules:

1. Don't touch something you’re not familiar with.

2. When in doubt, ask someone!

3. Each piece of machinery has rules, participants must follow your rules even if they think they know better.

(#1 Injury we've seen at TOM Makeathons - is by utility knives! Because people think they know how to use knives.)

##### 3. Team Time

Time for the team to work uninterrupted. During team time, the teams have the next 3 days to complete their challenge and design the best product. No one will disturb them and the machine shop will be available for them at all times.

##### 4. Campus Lane {#campuslane}

The idea is to give participants an opportunity to learn new things during the 72 hours. We believe heavily in learning-for-the-sake-of-learning so we don't want to waste any chance to acquire new knowledge. There should be three sessions over the three day period:

Session 1 : HOW TO GIVE A PRESENTATION: on the first day in the later afternoon/evening around 5pm.

Session 2: MOTIVATIONAL SPEECH: on the second day in the late morning around 11am. Choose this speaker wisely, they should motivate the team to feel inspired to keep working hard.

Session 3: PARTY: after lunch on the second day, pump everyone up up with a fun jam session or dance party that gets people stretching and recharging.

##### 5. PiNG

This is an opportunity to track progress, share what you need help with and set goals. At Makeathons, all the teams work hard, round-the-clock, focused on their projects. We want to support global communication and collaboration! When we all work together towards common goals, we achieve greater results.

**P**rogress since the last PiNG
**N**eeds you or your team needs help with from the larger community
**G**oals to meet by the next PiNG

*There is no ***_i_*** in ***_PiNG_**

**Length:** Every 6-8 hours for 10-30 minutes

**General Structure of All PiNG's**

Step 1: PiNG Coordinator welcomes the team representatives to the PiNG. Provides time requisites and details that each member should provide when speaking: 1 minute for each representative to speak, name, team name, Progress, Needs & Goals.

Step 2: PiNG Coordinator writes down each representative's' progress, needs and goals on a whiteboard.

Step 3: While the PiNG is happening, the PiNG Coordinator ensures that representatives are staying within the 1 minute timeframe and are following the progress, needs, goals framework and acts as an on-the-spot connector to resources.

**Structure of First PiNG**

Step 1: The PiNG coordinator will go around to every team and ask them to pick one representative that will attend every PiNG session.

Step 2: Re-introduces crucial TOM staff members at the first PiNG so that members may remember who their go-to contact is for their individual needs.

Step 3: Make sure each team knows how to access their budget.

**Tip: Create a Safe Space**

With innovation comes failure and failure leads to innovation. It is important that teams feel comfortable sharing their successes and their failures. Encourage them, ask what they need, and ask them what their next goals are.

Some leading questions for PiNG Coordinator:

1. What supplies do you need to develop your solution?

2. What you are trying to achieve until the next PiNG?

3. Do you have any missing skills or resources?

##### 6.** Demo Day**

Your teams present their solutions on the 3rd day of the event. Demo Day is a great opportunity to introduce your local community to TOM and to show what amazing solutions have been created at at your Makeathon. Send out invitations two weeks before TOM for the Demo Day to partners, sponsors, local leaders, donors, friends, and all other relevant guests.

Demo Day is split into two sections:

1st half, Presentations

2nd half, Ceremony

**Presentations**

The judges should be selected as industry experts, it is a great opportunity for partners to be involved. They should be recruited two months before the makeathon so that you can advertise their names on the website.

You should assign a staff member to the judges and the presentations to make sure the judges have food and coffee; and that the groups stick to the schedule and arrive punctually for their presentation.

Each Team will have 5 minutes to present and 3 minutes to answer questions. As part of Campus Lane, each team will learn how to present and they will use their new skills to prepare a 5 slide presentation for the judges:

1. Team Name

2. What was the challenge

3. Team Members

4. What is the solution

5. Next steps for the solution

**TOM Fair**

This is an open event and the public is welcome to visit. While the judges are judging - the teams are presenting their projects to visitors. The room should be set up like a science fair with a table for each team and a poster explaining their project.

**Deliberation**

The judges deliberate and decide which team wins each award.

**Criteria**

**[https://drive.google.com/a/tomglobal.org/file/d/0BwlJoN3Qeuc6Q2FwYXhNRThMRWs/view?ts=56fd387**8](https://drive.google.com/a/tomglobal.org/file/d/0BwlJoN3Qeuc6Q2FwYXhNRThMRWs/view?ts=56fd3878)

**Prizes**

All the prizes are for continued working on solutions, think creatively - from 3D printing hours, business consulting, a new Arduino Board, acceptance for an accelerator, design company consultancy.

**The Ceremony**

This is the closing event - have fun with set up, insert local flavor, champagne and Hors d'oeuvre are always welcome!

Set up chairs in an auditorium style and have a screen, projector, and microphone available.

Opening remarks should be made by the organizer thanking everyone for coming to the TOM. Each judge takes a turn announcing awards and each team takes a picture with their certificate.

A huge thank you and a job well done by everyone! Go home and go to sleep - you have organized an incredible event!

#### B. Designing Your Makerspace {#makerspace}

Space. It's everything. It dictates the way we interact with the physical environment and the people around us.

**Set-Up: **After months of hard work, it's finally the night before TOM and your production company is hard at work setting up the space. If you are not working with a production company, we recommend paying this group of staff for their time and providing snacks/drinks to ensure that everything is set up in a timely manner.

##### Accessibility

1. Two wheelchairs should be able to pass in the space between tables

2. Make the space accessible, ramps, directions to elevators, clear pathways

##### Power & Electricity

This section refers to power considerations when planning makespace.

##### Space checklist

1. Registration Table

2. Signage and branding the space

3. **Team Tables**

4. PiNG Area

5. Workshop, Workshop Stations, 3D Printers

6. Cafe, Food, Accommodations

7. Video Area*

8. Demo Day - Ceremony and Presentations

##### Signage & Branding Space

*All templates are included in the branding guidelines*

* Directions

* Elevators

* PiNG

* Schedules

* Workshop

* Placemats

##### Registration Table

* Schedules for each participant

* Name tags with lanyards

##### Team Tables

At a minimum, make sure that each team has a large table to work, chairs for the entire team, power source, pens and paper. Each table should have a sign with the team name and number (assigned in the PreTOM).  If possible, each table should have a 3D printer.

##### Workshop

1. When securing equipment or purchasing tools you should take into account the number of participants. The figures listed in the Book of TOM are for events sized 100-150 participants.

2. The makerspace and equipment listed provides the base for manufacturing abilities. Based on challenges and solutions developed, you may need additional materials or equipment.

3. Encourage participants to bring their own tools, materials, and manufacturing equipment at the PreTOM. Especially if they have a specific tool they love using and "must" have at the event!

4. Your makerspace should take in account the projects each team plans to execute and adjust the space accordingly

5. Whether you are working in an existing makerspace or building from scratch, adjustments should be made accordingly.

6. Team Budget

**The Workshop**

The 'dirty' area designated for machinery, processing tools and everything dusty, fumey or noisy (above 85db). This area should be acoustically and physically isolated and access and operated only by allowed personnel. Workshop are is an important part of the event and safety guidelines must be strictly followed.

**3D Printing Stations	**

3D printing is an essential part of the event, low end FDM 3D printers should be placed on team tables (one at each table if possible). If you secure high end 3D printers, they should be placed in highly visible locations in the main makeathon area, this is great for naturally creating a technologically innovative and active feel to the space.

1. **Low end FDM**

Putty knife

1 Kg of PLA/ABS

1 Kg of Flex material

1 SD Card

2. **High end Object**

3D printer

Waterjet cleaning stand

#### **C.  Food** {#food}

At TOM, we like keeping everyone well-fed, happy, and food and drinks are a great way for people to network. Participants are covered for food and beverages, including: breakfast, lunch, dinner and a midnight snack.

Cafe - In addition, a 24/7 coffee/tea station with hot and cold soft drinks and pastries should be available at all times. Beer and other treats are often given out in the evenings depending on budget and availability. We recommend having the food in a designated cafe area that is integrated into the event space.

Also consider menus: healthy foods such as veggies and meats are essential for the energy of your teams. Lastly, don't forget to ask people about dietary restrictions: veganism, vegetarianism, gluten free, allergies, halal, kosher etc.

#### D.  Accommodations {#accommodations}

Depending on the location of your event, you may choose to provide sleeping accommodations. Be sure to book accessible rooms for those that will need them and include the cost in your budget. We are encouraging round-the-clock working. An alternative to hotels is setting up couches, bean bags, hammocks, and cots for staff, participants and volunteers to nap. If possible, provide a private area for napping.**
