### Part 9: **Call for Challenge and Call for Talent**

About three months before the event takes place, send out the Call for Challenge and Call for Talent. The calls are usually open for a span of 3-4 weeks to maintain momentum. Partner organizations and companies should take an active role in recruitment from both the need and tech side to help cast a wide net and bring in as many relevant applicants and challenges as possible. This is one reason why having partners in both sectors is so vital to the success of your event!

The Call for Challenge and Call for Talent is a labor intensive process and requires a tremendous amount of sensitivity to what the challenges are and how to identify the right Makers with appropriate skills to develop solutions.

Terminology:

* **Applicants **

* **Registrants**

* **Participants **

**Online Registration for Participants **

In the [Makeathon Hub](http://mms.tomglobal.org/) you switch on the online application form for participants to register. Participants can find the application form on your Makeathon website.

What your Makeathon Hub will include:

* A place for both participants from the tech side and need side to submit their skills and apply for the event.

* A space for applicants to detail their technical skills and why they think they will be meaningful participants.

* Ask questions regarding personality to ascertain whether or not the applicant agrees with the TOM ethos and characteristic spirit.

Tips for advertising your Call for Challenge and Call for Talent:

* Social media

* Partner lists

* Local news channels

* Publications

* Rehabilitation centers

* Schools and Universities

**Screening & Selection**

Screening and selecting your participants is the best part, you finally get to see the vision of your TOM event take shape! Of course you will want to include all applicants but due to space, time, budgeting and efficiency you must be selective about who you accept. You want your participants to be committed and espouse the values of the TOM community while also wanting them to have the skills and know-how to make effective and viable solutions. **It is absolutely vital that you choose the challenges first in order to match the talent to each challenge.**

**Screening Challenges**

Split up the challenges between six screeners so every challenge appears on 2 or 3 lists. After all the challenges are reviewed, you will consolidate onto one list and the TOM Team will review the challenges one-by-one and decide which would be feasible.

There are other reasons why you may select a challenge:

1. A sponsor is bringing a team of makers and a challenge

2. The team collectively likes the person and wants them at the Makeathon

**Evaluation: ** (#evaluation)

1. Name

2. What is your connection to the challenge

3. Challenge Description

4. **Need Knower: **Who is the need knower for this project

*Rate from 1-10 and add up the points at the end:*

5. **Employability: **To what extent would a solution to this challenge enable people to get and / or hold a job

6. **Community inclusiveness / social benefits: **To what extent does addressing this challenge help people take part in the social web around them

7. **Scalability: **To what extent does this challenge have the potential to impact the life of 1000th, 100,00th and millions of people

8. **Extreme Affordability: **Estimate the ability of creating a solution for this challenge that will be economically feasible and within reach for people in need regardless of their economic situation

9. **Feasibility: **To what extent can we expect to be able to develop a proof of concept level solution over the course of the makeathon: One month to plan + 72 hours of prototyping

10. **Public interest: **How much do we estimate the challenge to attract participants', general public and media attention (How "photogenic" it is, if you will)

**Screening Talent**

The screening process for the Call for Talent follows the same methodology as the Call for Challenge. It requires more time as there are more applicants.

When screening, the screeners choose one of the four options, (1) Sure in (2) Sure out (3) Probably in (4) Probably out. If the majority rates someone as "sure in", then the TOM Team reviews the application. If most screeners indicate “Sure out”, the TOM Team does not review the application.

1. Is the applicant a maker?

2. Is the applicant (mostly) a designer?

3. Is the applicant (mostly) an engineer?

4. Is the applicant a need-knower?

5. Referred by?

6. Applicant is a "Sure in"

7. Most suitable project to be assigned

8. Applicant is "Probably in"

9. Applicant is "Probably out"

10. Applicant is a "Sure out"

11. Applicant is a "Sure in"

After the** participants** have been selected, send out acceptance letters. Only after you have confirmed acceptance do you send out the rejection letters to ensure that you have maximum participation. Try to be sensitive with rejection, you are limited by space and resources, recommend other ways the applicant can get involved in the future.

If you come across someone from the Call for Talent who possesses an extremely high level skill, you should ask them to join your team as a leader. For example, if this person is really techie you could ask him or her to work alongside your workshop manager or this person could become the workshop manager if you haven't yet selected somebody (which could happen but, ideally, you will already have your entire team in place beforehand).
