### Part 8: **Volunteers**

Whether you are working with a production company or not, you are planning a major event, having volunteer staff on hand to help out is crucial.  These are guidelines for volunteers, when you image the scope of your event, be sure to map out where you need volunteers and recruit accordingly.

**Recruitment: **Turn to partners for volunteers, from interns to mid-level managers, this is a great opportunity to be part of something great. Advertise at local universities, high schools and community centers.

**Volunteer love: **Volunteers are not free, you must budget for volunteer training, refreshments, meals, accommodations and swag.

**Volunteer roles: **Every event is different in terms of needing volunteers. You may not need any volunteers if you are using a production company or you may need 5 volunteers to 20 volunteers.

**Training: **Volunteers meet two weeks before the event. At the training they meet each other and the TOM Team, go over the schedule, and learn more about their roles. They must be trained on how to be good ambassadors of TOM. It is a good idea for them to have a good understanding of the schedule throughout the event in case participants ask them when lunch time will be. Everyone should leave with the Volunteer Coordinator's phone number in their phones.
