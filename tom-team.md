### Part 7: **The TOM Team**

Building a strong and committed team is fundamental to the success of your TOM event. Over the 3-4 month process of planning your TOM, your team will help you execute a TOM Makeathon to be remembered!

Each role requires various levels of engagement—some roles won't be as pertinent until the day of the event while others will begin day one of planning. We’ve added helpful tips for how to organize staff/volunteer meetings, staff trainings and a timeframe for recruiting your staff. The team should be in place two weeks before the [Call for Talent & Call for Challenge](calls.md).

  When you hire the production company, clarify who your point of contact will be at the company. The Production Coordinator and the production company will work in unison, from choosing an appropriate location, designing the space layout, making sure the electricity is sufficient, coordinating with the catering company, hiring an internet solution, arranging accommodations, setting up a registration/sign-in desk, creating a space for sponsors, handling graphics and printing, and everything else that will be involved with the production of the Makeathon.

Independent volunteer time will include emails, web work, phone calls, etc., but face to face time is just as important in your planning and will require scheduling different levels of availability. All staff on your team will need to make a commitment to clear their schedules for weekly executive staff meetings.
