### Part 4: Budget & Funding

#### **Budget** {#budget}

Every Makeathon varies in cost whether it be location, using an existing makerspace, the number of participants, or the grandiosity of the Makeathon. We created a sample budget spreadsheet to help you build your budget.

Take into account number of participants, staff and volunteers. From PreTOM, TOM and PostTOM to 3D printers, coffee and beer, we've itemized everything for what **you must have** and **what is nice to have**.

When you've completed the budget, add about  20% to your budget for unplanned expenses. When planning a large scale event, there are going to be things that fall between the cracks and that come up unexpectedly.

**Registration:** Participant registration fees serve mainly to confirm attendance, reduce the number of no-shows at the Makeathon, and cover some costs of the Makeathon. When deciding the amount, take into consideration local culture for events of this kind and coordinate with your TOM POC. Allocate some funding for discounts on registration for participants who cannot afford the fee.

#### **Funding** {#funding}

TOM Makeathons are grassroots community projects and budgeting and securing funding for the event is the responsibility of the organizer. Securing partnerships is a more challenging part of planning a TOM, but you will see that it is the most rewarding. It's empowering to watch the community stand beside you, supporting you with time, money and resources - all because you asked them to support the Makeathon.

Our motto is: Alone we can do so little, together we can do so much!

There are three important things to remember if you are nervous about fundraising:

1. People love hearing about great causes! You are changing the face of affordable assistive technology and by approaching someone for assistance, you are giving them the opportunity to take part in doing something meaningful.

2. When it comes to asking - the best case scenario is that people love TOM and jump on board, the worst case scenario is that they love TOM but can't support the makeathon at this time. Either way, you scored a new friend and one more person who loves TOM!

3. Keep in mind that people like knowing where their money is going - that's why we recommend that you build a budget before you start asking for sponsorships.

**Types of donations**

**In-kind donations, **a sponsor prefers to donate or give discounts for space, food, materials, printing, etc.

**Event sponsorships, **a sponsor prefers to donate money for general costs or a specific part of the Makeathon. Ask the sponsor to pay vendors directly so they and you know where the funding is going.

**IMPORTANT NOTE: **Sponsors have **no** editorial control or veto power over your program. Charities cannot use the event to fundraise for their cause. Any profits made should be used to cover costs. If sponsorships and funding exceeds the cost of the event, the profit will be allocated towards development of prototypes after the makeathon.

**Recognition for sponsorships**

Make sure to **detail expectations with partners**, specifically, their level of involvement. Even issues like the order, size, positioning and number of appearances of a logo can become surprisingly sensitive but must be well coordinated and communicated. Decide in advance how you would like to recognize different sponsorship levels.

1. Advertise their involvement

2. Thank sponsors by placing their logo on your website, collateral, press releases, signs, etc.

3. Publically thank sponsors for their partnership

4. Include their names in your media kit

5. Give each sponsor a table at the makeathon to showcase their involvement.

**Top tips for fundraising**

1. Remember to ask for money! It sounds simple, but the greatest fundraisers of all time have been known to get so wrapped up in what they are talking about that they walk away without asking for funding and leave completely empty handed.

2. Use your network. We all know someone who knows someone that can connect you to the person you want to speak with.

**Making a plan to fundraise**

1. **Compile a complete list of all potential partners in your area: **Corporations, hospitals, nonprofits, universities, foundations and philanthropists.

2. Review the list and decide what kind of sponsorships you are asking for from each potential partner

3. Map out where you have contacts and who can make introductions for you.

**Making the ask for funding**

1. Set up meetings with potentials sponsors

2. In the meeting, make the pitch and ask for a sponsorship

3. Send a thank you letter

4. Follow-up
