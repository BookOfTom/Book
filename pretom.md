### Part 10: **PreTOM**

About one month before the TOM, you will invite all the accepted participants for an evening to meet each other! The PreTOM is the first meeting of the TOM team, Makers, and Need Knowers. For the first time, teams will be assigned and participants will get started on their projects - towards finding a solution.

**Set-up**

* Accessible location with space that can be arranged first as an auditorium style and then with round tables. A lecture hall next to a classroom, or a room with workbenches in a makerspace are excellent.

*TIP: Based off our experience, just make sure that there is enough space for all attendees to sit comfortably and make sure spacing between tables is accessible for wheelchair users.*

* Registration table: name tags, **folder **with waiver, 1-pager, schedule for TOM

* Roll-up or sign: Welcome to TOM:Cityname

* Refreshments: Pizza and Beer are our all-time favorites, but make it be local if you want (and send us pictures).

* Decorate the room with brand colors

*TIP: TOM placemats can be a nice idea*

* Each table: Team name and project number, the challenge description and request-form for resources, tools, materials

* Direction signs

* Live streaming by a 3rd party vendor

**Staff**

All staff should be in attendance for questions and introductions. Each staff member has their special skills - let the participants know that you are available for design, engineering, professional need knowers expertise. Take the time to step out during the team time to say hello to each team.

**Participants**

Need knowers and Makers** ****must**** **participate in the PreTOM. There will be extenuating circumstances where participants cannot join, participant coordinator should schedule a 1-on-1 meeting with them between the PreTOM and TOM. No-show-ers may feel disconnected from the team, and it will be challenging to reassign their team assignments if you see it's a poor match.

##### **Waiver**

As part of registration, every Maker and Need Knower needs to sign a waiver giving permission for use of photos, video and testimonials on official documentation! If we do not have their permission they cannot participate in the makeathon. Children under 18 must co-sign with a parent or guardian.

**Partners**

You can invite partners to join the PreTOM, but they are not given any forum to present. This is a great opportunity to build relationships with sponsors or potential donors to experience the full TOM experience from stage 1.

**Schedule**

1. Registration: participants sign waivers and pay registration

2. Mingling and refreshments

3. 30-40 minutes structured with introductions: if you are in a rush, **present TOM,** challenges, workshops, and introduce tech team!

4. Tell everyone to like the group on Facebook

5. 1 hour for teams to break out to meet and collaborate. Each group is given a challenge questionnaire to ensure they understand the challenge and have all the resources they think they need. ***If they have special tools they love and cannot live without, tell them to bring their own! **

6. While the teams are working together - Participant Coordinator updates an excel sheet (or online form) of Makers and Need Knowers who participated, email, telephone, which project they took part on.

7. Group **PiNG** and goodbye

*TIP: When choosing a space, find a space that participants can stay late and don't need to leave immediately at the close of the PreTOM*

8. Teams should plan to meet, online or in person, 1-6 times independently before the TOM, it's up to each team to continue planning their solutions until the TOM Makeathon.
